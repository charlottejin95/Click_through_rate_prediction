# Click_through_rate_prediction
The Data set used in this analysis is **Kaggle Click-Through Rate Prediction competation sponsored by Avazu**. The goal is to determine the probability of whether someone would click on a mobile ad or not based on 10 days of their data. Due to the computation constrain, in this project, I use a sample of 100k rows from the dataset.

Data set used: [CTR Predcition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/overview)
